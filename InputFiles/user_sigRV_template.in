## Exposure time (in minutes)
<<texp>>
## Photon-noise limited RV measurement precision (in m/s). If set to zero, then it is computed from a model stellar spectrum 
<<sigRVphot>>
## RV activity rms (in m/s). Set to a negative value to sample its value rather than specifying it
<<sigRVact>>
## RV rms from additional planets (in m/s). Set to a negative value to sample its value rather than specifying it
<<sigRVplanets>>
## Effective RV rms (in m/s). Set to a non-zero value to be used verbatim rather than being calculated from the photon-noise limited RV rms, activity, and additional planet contributions
<<sigRVeff>>
